You are to write a function that displays the numbers from 1 to an input parameter n, one per line,
except that if the current number is divisible by 3 the function should write “Fizz” instead of the number,
if the current number is divisible by 5 the function should write “Buzz” instead of the number, and if the
current number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the function should write “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
